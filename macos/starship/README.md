# Starship

This directory contains the configuration files for the [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt that I use on my MacOS machines
and a setup file to automatically set it up in the correct location on the machine.

To use the setup script, simply execute the script from your terminal:
```zsh
./path/to/this/setup.zsh
```
